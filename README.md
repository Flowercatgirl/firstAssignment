# The Legend of Vilnius

This website is dedicated to the legend of Vilnius city foundation. It aims to educate more people about a beautiful tale that is known to every Lithuanian. Apart from having the legend written down, there is also an embedded video for those who want to watch. A separate page gives an information who is Gediminas, the main character of the legend.

## Accessibility

I have been mindful during coding to ensure that the website is as accessible friendly as possible. I have achieved this by:

  - Using semantic HTML.

  - Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.

  - Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.

  - Ensuring that all sections of the navigation are easily accessible at all times by making the header navbar stick to the top of the page while users scroll.
